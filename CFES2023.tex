\section{Preface}

I was hired by the University of Guam on October 1, 2003 under a limited-term,
split appointment (50\% extension and 50\% research). On June 26,
2008, I started a tenure-track appointment as extension entomologist
(100\% extension) with the academic rank of assistant professor. At
the end of the 2012 fall term I applied for tenure and promotion to associate professor and
received both in 2013. At the end of 2018 fall term I applied for promotion to
full professor and was promoted on July 11, 2019. 

I work within the Agriculture and Natural Resources Unit of the University
of Guam Cooperative Extension Service. I am a member of the
Environmental Science Graduate Program Faculty and a member of the Western
Pacific Tropical Research Center. 

I anticipate retirement from the University on October 1, 2023.

\subsection{ECA-PA1 Insect Diagnostic Services}
\begin{refsection}

\paragraph{Description}	
As an extension entomologist, a major part of my job is providing
insect identification and pest control recommendations to a diverse
clientele including commercial growers, gardeners, householders, GovGuam
agencies, federal agencies, and UOG colleagues. Most client contacts
are initiated by a phone call or a visit by the client to the ANR
office. In many cases identification and pest control recommendations
require a site visit by me and/or extension associates to collect
samples and define the problem.

\paragraph{Activities}
The number of extension calls requiring my assistance averaged approximately
one per day during the reporting period. Many of these are documented
as postings to iNaturalist \cite{moore_inat_from_2020-06-26_to_2023-06-26}.

\begin{comment}
\paragraph{Plans for 15JUN2021-14JUN2021}
I plan to continue providing insect diagnostic services.

\subsection{ECA-PA2 Detection and Documentation of Invasive Species}
\begin{refsection}

\paragraph{Description}
Invasive insects are arriving on Guam at a very high rate (estimates
range as high as one new species per day). Very few of these are detected
and even fewer are identified because Guam suffers from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_impediment}{the taxonomic impediment}.
Even when reliable species determinations are made, new island records
are only rarely documented in the scientific press. Thus, impacts
of invasive insects on Guam and elsewhere in Micronesia are grossly
underestimated. One of my professional goals is to work towards solving
this problem by increasing the detection rate, getting specimens identified
by qualified taxonomists, and publishing new island records in the
scientific literature.

\paragraph{Activities}
iNaturalist was used to document new records for insects detected in Guam and other Micronesian Islands \cite{inatSearchForNew}. 
Three new island records for insects on Guam were documented in iNaturalist posts during the reporting period \cite{inatAleurocanthus_woglumi, inatEncarsia_noyesi, inatConotelus_mexicanus}.

\begin{comment}
\paragraph{Plans for 15JUN2021-14JUN2022}

I will continue to document new island records of insects detected in Micronesia.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN-ISSG) is
building a Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species. I have
volunteered to coordinate building a check list for species on Guam.

The Guam Invasive Species Council is required to maintain a list on
invasive species on Guam. I have volunteered to be ``registrar''
for this list.

\subsection{ECA-PA3 University of Guam Insect Collection}
\begin{refsection}
	
\paragraph{Description}

The UOG insect collection is a valuable reference collection for extension
entomology, teaching and research. I am a member of the board of directors
for the collection and I work with Dr. Ross Miller to curate and catalog
this collection.

In 2018 I ported the digital catalog for the UOG Insect Collection from a
CSIRO BioLink database to a more modern web-based Symbiota database
which is publicly available online \cite{moore_scan_2023}. I also established an internship to train entomology students how to curate an institutional insect collection and how to add specimen images to the digital catalog\cite{moore_internship_2018}. However, this work came to a halt because of space limitations. 

Facilities provided for the UOG insect collection are very poor. The collection is literally \textit{moth balled} in a small storage room which is too small for essential equipment such as microscopes and cameras. Curation and digitization necessitates removing specimens from the collection and transporting them outdoors to a lab where there is working space and equipment.

\paragraph{Activities}

In 2022, I arranged for EPSCOR funding to have a door installed between the UOG insect collection and the adjacent ANR lab. Access to bench space in the lab will partially solve the space limitation problem described in the preceding section. During 2023, moth balls were added to all specimen drawers. As a result of Typhoon Mwar, the collection was without air conditioning for about three weeks.

\subsection{ECA-PA4 Mitigation of Damage to Guam's Ecosystems by Invasive Species}
\begin{refsection}

Guam's ecosystems are rapidly being degraded by invasive species. These include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Brown treesnake} which has extirpated Guam's forest birds, causing loss of ecosystem services they provided, such as seed dispersal, insect control and pollination.
	\item \textbf{Cycad aulacaspis scale insect}, ACS, which has killed more than 90\% of Guam's endemic cycads, known locally as \textit{fadang}. Fadang went from being the most abundant plant in Guam's forests in 2002 to being listed as an endangered species in 2015.
	\item \textbf{Coconut rhinoceros beetle}, CRB, which is killing coconut palms and palma brava throughout the island. These two palm species where the second and third most abundant trees in Guam's forest in 2002. 
\end{itemize}

Clearly, ecological disasters are happening on Guam, especially in forest ecosystems. As an extension entomologist, I am tasked with providing solutions to problems caused by insect pests. Unfortunately, there are no known methods for effectively controlling CAS and CRB on Guam. Therefor, I spend much of my time and effort performing applied research in an attempt to adequately control CAS and CRB so that restoration of Guam's forests can be attempted. 

\paragraph{Activities}

A new program entitled \textit{Plant Protection and Biosecurity for Guam and Micronesia} was submitted to the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. This program has been approved but not yet funded \cite{NIFA2022}.

Applied research is reported  in the Creative/Research/Scholarly in a section for CRB and a section for CAS.

\subsection{ECA-PA5 National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN)}
\begin{refsection}

\paragraph{Description}	

I served as the UOG Coordinator for the National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN). UOG receives about \$15K per year from NPDN as a subrecipient of the Western Plant Diagnostic Network administered by UC Davis. 

%Grant details are in  sections \ref{WPDN2}, \ref{WPDN3} and \ref{WPDN4YR}.

\paragraph{Activities}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Participated in monthly conference calls.
	\item Prepared and submitted annual reports.
	\item Prepared a \href{https://github.com/aubreymoore/WPDN/raw/main/4year/WPDN\%20FY23-FY26\%20workplan\%20and\%20budget\%20for\%20UOG.pdf}{four-year work plan and budget for FY2023-FY2026}.
	\item Made a presentation entitled \textit{The Invasive Species Problem on Guam} \cite{moore_invasive_2022} at the 2022 WPDN annual meeting (via Zoom).
	\item In June 2023, I resigned as WPDN coordinator.
	I am currently working with the new WPDN coordinator, Jesse Bamba, to ensure a smooth transition.

\subsection{ECA-PA6 Guam Invasive Species Advisory Committee (GISAC) and Guam Invasive Species Council (GISC)}
\begin{refsection}
	
I am a founding member and regular participant in GISAC. President Underwood delegated me to represent UOG as a voting member of GISC and President Krise reconfirmed my delegation.

\paragraph{Activities}

I participate in GISAC and GISC meetings. Unfortunately, there have been none during the current reporting period.

A GISC meeting was scheduled at Adelup on May 24, 2023. However, this was the day that Typhoon Mwar visited Guam. This GISC meeting has been postponed with a date yet to be set. I prepared a report on invasive species activities at the University of Guam \cite{GISC2023}.

\subsection{ECA-PA7 Public Outreach: Internet}

Since the 1990s, I have built and maintained web sites to facilitate sharing information about insects in Micronesia. I created a wiki site to serve as an index to web resources I have developed (Available at  \url{https://guaminsects.net/aubwiki2020}). I will continue to use web sites to facilitate sharing information on Guam's insects.
\begin{comment}
\paragraph{Plans for 15JUN2021-14JUN2022}
I will continue to create and maintain websites about insects in Micronesia.

\subsection{ECA-PA8 Public Outreach: Presentations}
\begin{refsection}

I helped to organize a meeting of the Guam Native Plant Society which was held at the UOG ALS Teaching Lab (ALS124) on Saturday, January 21, and I gave a presentation at this meeting (REF). The topic of this meeting was \textit{Guam insects associated with \textit{Glochidian}} \cite{mooreGlochidion2023}.

On Saturday, April 15, 2023, I made a presentation as part of a workshop on growing hot peppers on Guam \cite{mooreInterestingFactsChili2023}.

\subsection{ECA-PA9 Public Outreach: Miscelleaneous}

On March 30 2023 I participated in a 4H workshop for military children by making presentations on local insects.

\subsection{ECA-PA10 Public Outreach: Public GitHub Repositories}

I attempt to provide access to as much of my work as possible using public GitHub repositories. GitHub is a free service for backing up and sharing documents on the web. Repositories which I have created or updated during the reporting period are listed in Table \ref{repolist}.  The document you
are reading, all previous versions, and related data are stored in a public GitHub directory
at
https://github.com/aubreymoore/CFES2020-22. The document can be read online or
downloaded as a PDF from
https://github.com/aubreymoore/CFES2020-22/blob/main/
CFES2021-06-15to2022-06-14.pdf

I also use GitHub pages for serving static websites. A couple of good example sites are one which I created for my \href{https://aubreymoore.github.io/ALBI-345/}{ALBI345 General Entomology} course and one which is a \href{https://aubreymoore.github.io/crop-pest-list/}{List of Insects and Mites Attacking Crops in Micronesia}.

I will continue to create and maintain public GitHub repositories to provide access to my work as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science}{open science}.

\subsection{CSR-PA4 Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB) Biocontrol and Related Activity}\label{sec:coconut-rhinoceros-beetle-(crb)-biocontrol}
\begin{refsection}
	
\paragraph{Description}

A newly discovered biotype of coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB-G) is
rapidly killing coconuts and other palms on Guam and on other Pacific
islands. Following a failed eradication attempt on Guam, CRB-G proved
hard to control because it is resistant to \emph{Oryctes rhinoceros}
nudivirus (OrNV), which was previously used as the preferred biological
control agent for control of CRB outbreaks on Pacific Islands and
elsewhere. Prior to the discovery of CRB-G, all OrNV releases on
Pacific Islands resulted in immediate and sustained suppression of
CRB damage to low levels and prevented tree mortality.

Guam is currently experiencing an uncontrolled and unmonitored island-wide
CRB-G outbreak which was triggered by abundant CRB-G breeding sites
in the form of dead and dying vegetation left in the wake of Typhoon
Dolphin which occurred in May 2015. Most of these
breeding sites are inaccessible to sanitation efforts, being either deep
in the jungle or on military land (which covers one third of Guam).
A positive feedback cycle has begun whereby large numbers of adult
beetles are killing large numbers of palms which become breeding sites
which generate even higher numbers of adults. Severe damage to Guam's
palms prompted the Governor of Guam to declared a state of emergency
in July 2017.

The main objective of this project is to stop the uncontrolled outbreak
on Guam. Entomologists working on the CRB-G problem on several Pacific
islands agree that the most feasible tactic to halt tree mortality
and suppress damage to tolerable levels is establishment of biological
control using an isolate of OrNV which is highly effective as a biological
control agent for CRB-G. We are working with collaborators to identify
populations of CRB-G throughout the Asia-Pacific region. We will sample
these populations for biological control agent candidates which will
be evaluated in laboratory bioassays performed at UOG. Promising candidates
will be field released using autodissemmination as per a USDA-APHIS
import and release permit.

Concurrent with establishment of CRB-G biocontrol, success of the
project will be monitored in a quarterly, island-wide tree health
survey and incidence of OrNV infection will be monitored in a subsample
of all field collected CRB-G.

If the Guam CRB-G infestation cannot be controlled, it is expected
that most palms on the island will be killed and CRB-G will continue
to spread to other islands and beyond. If CRB-G invades smaller islands
and atolls where coconut is the tree of life, a human tragedy will
ensue. On larger islands, coconut and oil palm industries will be
severely impacted. Attempts to organize a well-funded, coordinated regional project in response to CRB-G have failed underway. However, UOG plays a major role in the \textit{ad hoc} CRB-G Action Group which was established to facilitate sharing scientific/technical information among people working on the CRB-G problem.

\paragraph{Funding and Project Management} This is my largest and most important project, requiring a lot of time and effort for project management including preparation of grant proposals and reports. During the reporting period, funding was provided by 2 grants totaling \$361,234: OIA-CRB, FS-CRB and FS-CRB-HR.  Details, including links to project proposals, work plans and progress reports are available in the grants section of this report.

\paragraph{Staffing}

Grant funding for this project supports 2 full-time technicians, Christian Cayanan and Laura Caser, and two part-time technicians, Leah Bukurou and Ed Bayson.

\paragraph{CRB-G biocontrol} 

We will continue performing bioassays until a potential OrNV biocontrol candidate is found. Once we have one, we will begin propagation \textit{in vivo} and field releases via autodissemination. I already have a USDA-APHIS permit for field release of OrNV.

The current priority is to perform a critical laboratory bioassay to test for significant reduction in fecundity (egg laying) caused by OrNV isolate V23B. This isolate caused significant mortality in bioassays performed in our lab and also in the Solomon Islands. However, according to some of the literature, the main mode of action causing population reduction by OrNV is not mortality but reduction in fecundity. Given the long lifespan of CRB, this experiment will require at least a year (includes lab rearing of test insects).

\paragraph{Establishment of a CRB Rearing Facility and Rearing Protocol}

Development of biocontrol for CRB-G will require laboratory bioassays using standardized, healthy lab-reared beetles of equivalent age. Previously, we used beetles collected from pheromone traps for this purpose. However, mortality in experimental control groups was highly variable, yielding irreproducible results. 

During the reporting period:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We built and equipped a CRB rearing facility in a 40 foot shipping container.  
	\item We developed and tested a natural larval diet by grinding dead standing coconut stems containing CRB breeding sites.
	\item A recent experiment shows that the growth rate of CRB larvae is greatly increased by adding field-collected larval frass to neonate larvae. We suspect that this increase in growth rate is due to addition of gut symbionts present in the frass.	
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Establishment of an Island-wide CRB Damage Monitoring System}

We developed an island-wide roadside monitoring system to track spatial and temporal changes in CRB damage levels. Data are collected using a smart phone attached to a project vehicle. The phone continually records georeferenced roadside images as the vehicle is driven along all major results in both directions. Data are automatically analysed by an image analysis system which detects coconut palms in the images, calculates a damage index for each palm, and outputs results on a map of Guam. A nontechnical overview of this system was published in the 2020 WPTRC Impact Report \parencite{moore_using_2020-1}.

To date, we have completed eight island-wide surveys and data for a ninth survey were recorded in June 2023 but have not yet been analyzed. Interactive damage maps and data are available on the web:

\section{}

The first \textbf{Pacific Ecological Security Conference} (PESC) held in Palau during October 2022, brought together island leaders, development partners, regional organizations, agricultural/food security and natural resource managers, and the media to discuss the importance of managing and preventing the spread of invasive species in Pacific Island environments \cite{anonymousFirstPacificEcological2022}.

Conference hosts and sponsors included Government of Palau Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Environment, Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), the East-West Center, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Nature Conservancy, the US Department of the Interior - Office of Insular Affairs, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Ocean Policy Research Institute.

Delegates from Guam were Roland Quitugua and Aubrey Moore from UOG and Glenn Dulla and Andrea Blas from the Department of Agriculture. The Guam delegation participated in a satellite meeting organized by the U.S. Department of the Interior - Office of Insular Affairs and the U.S. Forest Service. At this meeting each island group presented a status report on invasive species issue (See \parencite{mooreOverviewInvasiveSpecies2022-10-06} for slides from the Guam presentation). This was followed by discussions on federal funding and collaboration.  

\textbf{Strategic Action Plan for Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB).}
Prior to the PESC, members of the Guam delegation worked with colleagues throughout the Pacific to write a Pacific-wide strategic action plan for response to the recent spread of CRB. This plan was accepted by PESC delegates and has been published online \cite{conferenceStrategicActionPlan2022}.

The plan includes five objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Enhance Regional Coordination and support of PICTs to achieve the
	objectives of the CRB Strategic Action Plan (SAP)
	\item Conduct immediate and long-term collaborative research to develop
	tools and understanding necessary to enable effective CRB prevention, control, and
	eradication
	\item Prevent the spread of CRB to new locations in the Pacific region and
	beyond
	\item Implement an active early detection, and rapid response system for new
	outbreaks at regional and island levels
	\item Improve implementation of control efforts and mitigate the impacts of
	CRB where already present in the region
	
\end{enumerate} 

\paragraph{Outreach} In an effort to facilitate sharing technical and scientific information among people working on CRB, I have developed and maintain several online resources including a wiki \parencite{moore_crb-g_2019}, a Facebook site \parencite{moore_facebook_2019}, an online interactive map of CRB invasion history \parencite{moore_online_2019} and a CRB reference library \parencite{moore_online_2021}, and an online email discussion site \parencite{moore_online_2021-1}.

To share information with the general public on Guam and elsewhere in Micronesia I initiate and participate in writing press releases and I also interact with reporters. Examples of recent stories published by the local media include:

\begin{itemize}
	
\item \textbf{Entomologist reveals origins of rhino beetle in Marianas}, by Thomas Manglona, KUAM 2023-03-03 \cite{manglonaEntomologistRevealsOrigins2023}

\item \textbf{UOG, Tokyo University test a rhino beetle virus from Palau on Guam’s beetles}, press release by Jackie Hanson, CNAS-UOG 2023-05-04 \cite{hansonUOGTokyoUniversity2023}

\item \textbf{UOG, partners studying virus to curb invasive beetle population} by Richelle Aguon, Guam Daily Post 2023-05-29 \cite{postUOGPartnersStudying2023}

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Harmonic radar}
%\begin{refsection}
I am investigating the feasibility of using harmonic radar using funding from a US Forest Service grant [\ref{FS-CRB-HR}]. Details of this applied research are available as a preprint journal article \cite{moore_detecting_2022}. This work is being done in collaboration with Dr. Matt Siderhurst, a chemical ecologist at Eastern Mennonite University, Virginia. I am also collaborating with Dr. Glenn Dulla, Guam Department of Agriculture on the feasibility of using a harmonic radar unit attached to a drone.

\subsection{CSR-PA5 Guam Biodiversity Inventory}
\begin{refsection}
	
	\paragraph{Description}
	
	I consider this to be my second most important project.
	
	A biodiversity inventory is essentially a database containing a comprehensive
	check list of all taxa known occur within a defined area.
	
	A terrestrial biodiversity inventory for Guam is needed to document
	rapid changes to Guam's ecosystems, to provide free
	and open access to information on Guam's flora and
	fauna, and to share Guam biodiversity information with the global
	scientific community, policy makers and the public.
	
	The Guam Biodiversity Inventory will facilitate automatic generation
	and updates to lists such as: a list of all invasive species on Guam
	with year first recorded, a list of new species described from specimens
	collected on Guam, a list of observations for Guam's
	endangered species, a list of Guam's native plants
	with associated herbivores and pathogens, and a list of crops grown
	on Guam and pests and pathogens which attack them.
	
	\paragraph{Activities}
	
	\paragraph{Funding} This project is supported by my McIntire-Stennis grant \ref{BIODIVERSITY} which terminates on 2022-09-30.
	
	\paragraph{Staffing} I offered an internship to work on this project to Annette Kang, a graduate student from Guam currently working on a PhD in Entomology at Cornell University. Progress on this project was impeded because of a nine month delay in processing my interns stipend payment.  	
	
	\paragraph{Data mining} During the reporting period, the focus within this project was to extract data from legacy entomological literature for Guam, namely \textit{Insects of Guam} I and II. This work was facilitated using a sophisticated workflow developed by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plazi}{Plazi}, a Swiss-based international non-profit association supporting and promoting the development of persistent and openly accessible digital biodiversity information. The Plazi office in Brazil kindly supported this project by provided online training sessions for myself and Annette. Data extracted from the literature are automatically published on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility as datasets and occurrence records. I wrote an \href{https://aubreymoore.github.io/data-mining-insects-of-guam/validator2/status_report.html}{online dashboard to track our data-mining progress}. More details are available in my 2021 annual report for this project \cite{moore_guam_2021}

\subsection{CSR-PA6 Cycad Aulacaspis Scale (CAS) Biocontrol}
\label{CASbiocontrol}
\begin{refsection}

\paragraph{Description}

A US Forest Service survey published in 2002 reported that the most
abundant tree in Guam's forests (DBH > 5 inches) was Guam's endemic
cycad, \emph{Cycas micronesica}. In 2003, an invasive scale insect,
\emph{Aulacaspis yasumatsui}, was detected on ornamental cycads but
it soon infested wild cycads and started killing them. Within a decade,
90\% of Guam\textquoteright s endemic cycads have been killed by the
scale and other invasive species. \emph{Cycas micronesica} was placed
on the US National Endangered Species List in 2015.

Mature plants are protected by a lady beetle I introduced, but no
natural reproduction of the cycads is occurring because seeds and seedlings are
still being killed by the scale insect. A likely solution to this
problem is establishment of a small biocontrol agent, such as a miniature
parasitic wasp, which will control scale insects infesting seeds and
seedlings.

\paragraph{Activities}

I collaborated with Dr. Jim McConnell on insect pests impacting cycads on Tinian and Guam. I set up a pest monitoring of cycads in conservation plots on Tinian using leaf samples \cite{moore_monitoring_2022} and yellow sticky traps \cite{moore_monitoring_2022-1}.

In March 2022, I hosted a visit from Dr. Ron Cave from the University of Florida. Ron is an expert on CAS biocontrol and I have been trying to get him out here on a consulting trip for several years. Some discussions with USFWS earlier this year led to them funding the trip.

During his trip, Ron and I hosted a Zoom seminar on CAS biocontrol. I put recordings of the presentations and discussion online \cite{cave_biological_2022-1}. After the trip, Dr. Cave provided \href{https://github.com/aubreymoore/CAS-biocontrol-seminar/raw/main/Cave-CAS-report-2022.pdf}{comprehensive consulting report complete with recommendations}. 

In addition, I coauthored a book chapter on CAS biocontrol with Ron Cave and Mark Wright, University of Hawaii.

Note that my work on CAS biocontrol is currently unfunded. \cite{cave_biological_2022}.

\begin{comment}
\paragraph{Plans 15JUN2021-14JUN2022}

I am collaborating with the US Fish and Wildlife Service on prospects for CAS biocontrol. On my suggestion USFWS is considering funding a consulting trip to Guam by Dr. Ron Cave, a CAS biocontrol expert from the University of Florida.  

\paragraph{Plans 15JUN2022-14JUN2023}
I will work to help find funding to implement Dr. Cave's recommendations.

\subsection{CSR-PA7 Eight Spot Butterfly (ESB) Conservation}
\begin{refsection}

\paragraph{Description}

The Guam Department of Agriculture Division of Aquatic and Wildlife
Resources (GDOA-DAWR) requested assistance with conservation of the
rare Mariana eight-spot butterfly, \emph{Hypolimnas octocula marianensis}. I prepared a grant proposal and a permit application to do this work under a cooperative agreement with the GDOA-DAWR.

The objective of this project is to investigate the feasibility of captive rearing.

\paragraph{Activities}

I have partnered with Dr. Curt (George) Fiedler, Biology Department, and the Center for Island Sustainability to collaborate on this project.

A large field cage (20x20X10 feet) has been built in the UOG Center for Island Sustainability compound in Dean's Circle and a shade house has been stocked with host plants. 

On 2020-05-25, I organized a Zoom conference call with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to discuss conditions of a new permit which will allow UOG and the Guam Department of Agriculture - Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources to work on captive breeding of the Mariana eight-spot butterfly.
\begin{comment}
\paragraph{Plans 15JUN2021-14JUN2022}

I will assist in requesting a new permit from USFWS to work with the eight-spot butterfly. Experimental facilities will be constructed at the Center for Island Sustainability compound on the UOG campus.

\paragraph{Plans 15JUN2022-14JUN2023}

Eight-spot butterfly breeding experiments will commence within the next 2 months.

\section{Grants which were active during the reporting period (n=7; \$494,446)}

During the reporting period, I managed 7 grants totalling \$494,446 (see Table \ref{grantlist} and Fig. \ref{gannt}). Four of these grants expired during the period. Final reports were submitted and accepted. The Western Plant Diagnostic Network grants (WPDN2 and WPDN3) have recently been transferred to Jesse Bamba as the new UOG coordinator for this ongoing project. Two grants funding my CRB work remain active, DOI-OIA and FS-CRB. I will submit final reports for these grants before I retire.
