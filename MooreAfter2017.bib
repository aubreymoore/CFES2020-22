  abstract = {Coconut palm is both an important food resource and a cultural icon for Guam and all tropical islands of the Pacific.  Guam in particular among the Insular Pacific islands has been especially hard hit by invasive species due to its centuries-long history as a transportation hub and strategic military location.  Health of the overall coconut palm population in Guam is declining more rapidly in recent years since Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) was first detected in 2007 in Tumon.  Tinangaja, a slow-acting, lethal disease caused by the Coconut tinangaja viroid, was previously known only in Guam.  Prior to the introduction of CRB, Tinangaja disease was reported to affect 30\% of the coconut palm population.  Anecdotal reports of the disease in Rota and Tinian have emerged and visual diagnosis confirmed by the authors.  Results of currently on-going surveys for Tinangaja in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands will be presented.  Additionally, the potential impact of CRB expansion on Tinangaja disease incidence will be presented with an overview of CRB management and biocontrol programs in Guam.},

  abstract = {Scale-infested cycad leaves were sampled on the island of Guam in a wide range of habitats in 2017 and 2018 to determine the extent of parasitoid control of the scale. The sampling unit was a leaflet selected from five trees per habitat during each sampling date. The number of scales were counted with a hand lens and parasitoids were reared in a growth chamber at 60\% relative humidity. Infested leaflets were transferred to new rearing vessels after 48 hour intervals and returned to the growth chamber. Insects were rinsed with 70\% EtOH and parasitoids were counted with the aid of a microscope. The abaxial leaflet surfaces harbored greater numbers of scale than the adaxial surfaces. In a Northern Guam site where parasitoids were first fortuitously discovered in 2013, only 20\% of the samples yielded parasitoids. For each geographic site, the presence of parasitoids on one sampling date did not always lead to evidence of parasitoids at a later sampling date. The number of parasitized scales was minimal despite the widespread geographic occurrence of the parasitoids. Several native and exotic Cycas cycad species were historically heavily used in the commercial and residential landscapes of Guam, and the recent invasion of the cycad Aulacaspis scale (CAS) Aulacaspis yasumatsui Takagi has devastated these cycad populations. These results provide the first evidence that scale parasitoids are established throughout most of the island, but they are not effectively controlling the scale infestations. This case study is an example of how the horticulture profession can aid in responding to an ecological disaster.},

  abstract = {Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) was first detected on Guam during 2007. Following a failed eradication program, we attempted to establish effective microbial control using Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) imported from AgResearch New Zealand and green muscardine fungus (GMF), Metarhizium majus, imported from the Philippine Coconut Authority. OrNV was initially released by autodissemination but did not result in population suppression. Molecular analyses indicated that the Guam population is genetically distinct from other populations which had invaded Pacific Islands and laboratory bioassays indicated that this genotype is resistant to infection by OrNV isolates commonly used and released in the Pacific region. This novel biotype has been named CRB Biotype G (CRB-G) and it is spreading throughout the Pacific. GMF was released by autodissemination and incorporation of spores into CRB breeding sites. An extensive post- release survey indicated that field mortality from GMF was between 10\% and 38\%. Population suppression by GMF coupled with breeding site sanitation and other integrated pest management tactics did not prevent an uncontrolled island-wide CRB outbreak triggered by Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Adults emerging from abundant CRB breeding sites generated by this typhoon were numerous enough to kill large numbers of mature coconuts, initiating a positive feedback cycle whereby adults emerging from dead palms kill even more palms. History indicates that the most feasible way to stop the current outbreak on Guam is to find and release an OrNV isolate which is pathogenic for CRB-G. We are currently locating populations of CRB-G biotype within its native range and looking for OrNV isolates from these populations which can be used for effective microbial control.},

  abstract = {Guam's ecosystems are under attack by invasive species. Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown tree snake which invaded the island shortly after WWII. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known. In 2002 a US Forest Service survey found the endemic cycad, Cycas micronesica, to be the most abundant tree in Guam's forests and coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, to be the second most abundant tree. Both species are now under severe attack by invasive insect species. About 90\% of C. micronesica trees have been killed by Asian cycad scale, Aulacaspis yasumatsui, first detected in 2003. The predatory beetle, Rhyzobius lophanthae, was introduced and it is protecting mature plants but no seedlings are surviving. Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, was first detected in 2007 and an uncontrolled outbreak of this pest is currently killing coconut palms throughout the island. Following a failed eradication attempt, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) and Metarhizium majus fungus were introduced as biocontrol agents. OrNV unexpectedly failed as a biocontrol agent for CRB on Guam. Previously, this pathogen produced excellent results when released on Pacific Islands infested with CRB. Subsequent laboratory bioassays and genetic analysis showed that the CRB which invaded Guam belong to an OrNV resistant biotype named CRB-G which is involved in all recent invasions of CRB in the Pacific. The fungus, M. majus rapidly established and spread to CRB breeding sites throughout the island, with infection rates measured between 10\% and 38\%. But this level of suppression was not enough to prevent the current outbreak which was triggered by abundant breeding sites left in the wake of Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Attempts to overcome these IPM failures will be discussed.},
