	abstract = {Coconut rhinoceros beetle ({CRB}), Oryctes rhinoceros L., is a serious pest of coconut and oil palms throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific. {CRB} was found on Guam in 2007 and, despite suppression efforts, has subsequently spread across the island. The {CRB} population on Guam is genetically different from other populations in Asia and the Pacific, and is considered a new invasive biotype (termed {CRB}-G). {CRB}-G is apparently resistant to Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus, the preferred biocontrol agent for this pest. {CRB} populations are typically controlled with a combination of biocontrol, pheromone traps, and breeding site removal. A field trial was performed at six locations on Guam to test potential improvements to standard {CRB} pheromone trapping with oryctalure (ethyl 4-methyloctanoate). Two modifications were tested, 1) addition of ultraviolet light emitting diodes ({UV} {LEDs}), and 2) reduction of pheromone release rate. Addition of {UV} {LED} light sources to pheromone traps significantly increased trap catch by 2.85 times. Reduction in oryctalure release rate by up to an order of magnitude did not significantly change {CRB} capture rate. Further, when linear regression analyses of {CRB} trap capture rate as a function of pheromone release rate were conducted for traps with and without {UV} {LEDs} separately, only a very weak relationship between trap capture and oryctalure release rate was observed and only when a {UV} {LED} was present. Results suggest that addition of {UV} {LED} light sources to pheromone traps could improve detection trapping of {CRB} and that reduction of pheromone release rate could extend service life of lures without changing capture rate.},

	abstract = {Coconut rhinoceros beetle, a major pest of coconut and oil palms, is causing severe economic and environmental damage following recent invasions of several Pacific islands. Population suppression and eradication of this pest requires location and destruction of active and potential breeding sites where all life stages aggregate. Three search tactics for discovering breeding sites have been used with limited success: visual search by humans, search with assistance from detector dogs, and search by tracking {CRB} adults fitted with radio transmitters.Here we suggest a fourth search tactic: releasing {CRB} adults fitted with harmonic radar tags to locate breeding sites. Our idea is to find static end points for tags which accumulate at breeding sites, rather than active tracking of individual beetles. We plan to use commercially available hand-held harmonic radar devices. If we are successful, this technique may be useful for locating other insects which aggregate, such as hornets and other social insects.},
