	abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), is one of the most damaging pests to coconut palms causing severe economic harm. Its expansion from Asia to the Pacific in the early 20th century has been stopped by virus control. However, a new haplotype CRB-Guam has recently escaped this control and invaded Guam, other Pacific islands, and has even established itself in the Western Hemisphere. In this paper, we present a compartmental ODE model of CRB population and control. We carefully consider CRB life stages and its interplay with coconut palms as well as “the green waste”, the organic matters used by CRB for breeding sites. We calibrate and validate the model based on data count of CRBs trapped in Guam between 2008 and 2014. We derive the basic reproduction number determining the CRB population growth without any control measures. We also identify control levels required to eliminate CRBs. We show that, in the absence of viable virus control, the sanitation, i.e., the removal of the green waste is the most efficient way to control the population. Our model predicts that the sanitation efforts need to roughly double from the current levels to eliminate CRB from Guam. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a rare event like Typhoon Dolphin that hit Guam in 2015 can lead to a quick rise of the CRB population.},

	abstract = {Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), a major pest of coconut and oil palms, is causing severe economic and environmental damage following recent invasions of several Pacific islands. Population suppression and eradication of this pest requires location and destruction of active and potential breeding sites where all life stages aggregate. Three search tactics for discovering breeding sites have been used with limited success: visual search by humans, search with assistance from detector dogs and search by tracking CRB adults fitted with radio transmitters.Here, we suggest a fourth search tactic: releasing CRB adults fitted with harmonic radar tags to locate breeding sites. Our idea is to find static end points for tags which accumulate at breeding sites, rather than active tracking of individual beetles. We plan to use commercially available hand-held harmonic radar devices. If we are successful, this technique may be useful for locating other insects which aggregate, such as hornets and other social insects.},
